# Preparation interview 1

## Suggested questions from invite

* What are you most excited about building in Open Science when you have the fellowship bandwidth to build on your current projects?
  1. Onboarding module for beginning researchers to encourage critical reflection of the research process and actively committing to certain practices a prior, incorporating the most recent meta-research. This pertains to everything from starting a project, managing a project, sharing a project, preserving a project, and publishing about a project. All aspects will come with modular elements that address varying levels of openness, similar to the TOP guidelines for journals.
    a. Budding researchers get much training in content, but less about the quickly changing landscape within which this content is generated.
    	* Increasingly important to understand the reliability and preservability of content. 
    	* But, much of this teaching is implicit and between early career researchers (ECRs) themselves, if it is taught at all, which is severely ineffective and pedagogically incomplete.
    		* I got zero onboarding when I started, and in hindsight there is much that could've been readily taught and would have proven highly effective.
    	* This is a severe hurdle for uptake of open science practices. For example, data is often not shared because there is no training in how to do so (work in preparation by a colleague that ironically, I am not at liberty to share at this moment). 
    	* Moreover, it is easy to miss specific aspects of doing research (e.g., someone focuses only on data sharing but not preservation) or regard them as separate issues that compete, whereas they all act towards one larger goal (which often happens between data and access).
    	* Supervisors are from different era, don't reflect much on the higher-level research process and cannot be expected to teach cutting-edge methods. 
    		* By engaging ECRs, and asking them to determine what level of openness they want to commit to (in TOP guidelines fashion) will promote discussion. Also, this is a foot-in-the-door.
    		* I think that activating issues early, among young researchers, will also promote discussion with and among more seniored researchers. 
    b. Additionally, there are many hurdles in doing research that are not only essential for  how research is done, but also for mental health, diversity, preventing RSI, which are required to be an effective researcher.
    c. Moreover, if implicit/tacit training occurs, it often happen within universities, systematically excluding citizen scientists from this kind of knowledge.
    d. An open educational resource addresses the content and allows for bridging the gap between affiliated and non-affiliated researchers just starting out.
    e. Part of the module will be connecting researchers in an Open Leadership fashion, using both a mentor- and cohort buddy system.
    	* This also to increase diversity among researchers who are connected (geographically, content, personal background)
    	* I'll first implement it locally with the graduate schools at Tilburg.
    	* It'll be open to contributions from the users of the OER.
  2. Canvassing legal landscape for access to research as a human right.
    a. Under UDHR 27 there might be precedent to make a legal case for free access to scholarly research
    b. I want to use some of the Fellowship funds to directly fund law scholars to independently investigate this.
    c. This is also the underlying principle of Alexandra Elbakyan [for Sci-Hub](https://doi.org/10.1038/545145a).
    d. This is worth investigating because now it remains claims without thorough analysis of the legal issues. 

* How to you see your work coordinating with our projects, programs, and upcoming events/initiatives: [https://science.mozilla.org/](https://science.mozilla.org/)
  1. During MozSprint I saw the great variety of community projects and I'd systematically contribute to them by interweaving them into the the onboarding modules, either as knowledge base or as . 
    a. For example
      *[Preprint journal club](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub)
      * [Why not open science](https://github.com/dasaderi/WhyNotOpenScience)
  2. I see a community driven effort similar to the Open Leadership programme to engage ECRs in reflecting on the research process.

* What are you most looking for in terms of collaborators in the coming year (disciplinary focus, institutions, particular types of people -- scientists, developers, web activists etcet)?
  1. Explicitly, I will primarily be looking for research users _and_ contributors.
  2. However, I have tons of ideas I want to put into practice that relate to open science

* We'll be coordinating the Open Innovation floor at this year's Mozfest, modeled after the theme in our Internet Health Report. Do you have thoughts on how your research might tie into "open innovation"? Thinking about submitting a proposal to Mozfest? Tell us more.
	1. First off, I've never been to MozFest, so I'm not fully sure I understand how it works. Nonetheless, I'd like to suggest a session at MozFest regarding access to research as a human right. 
		* Such a session can spark discussion about whether we should be regarding it as such, and can warm up the scene for legal investigations into this. Potentially it'd be possible to get a video connection with Alexandra Elbakyan to explain her position on it when she started Sci-Hub. I imagine it to be a stimulating and exciting session, albeit in a more traditional format. 
		* Open content promotes open innovation. If access is a human right, we're one step closer to true open content. THis is why I was thinking about submitting this as a session, although I am unsure whether MozFest is the right setting.
		* Alternatively, it would include a part where attendees would imagine a world where all content is available. What would they do with that content? There recently was an app created that is a Tinder for science; what else can we come up with to innovate on free and reusable content that promote the potential of access?

## Questions for Mozilla

1. Is there any financial reporting standards that need to be maintained or would the fellowship be lump sum? (in case I'd need to prepare for that)

2. What reporting procedures are there, if any?

3.
