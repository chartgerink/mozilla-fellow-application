# Interview round 2 preparation

Made it to the second round! :confetti_ball:

> We'll be looking to gain a better sense as to how your research will be supported at your institution, and how you plan to build trans-disciplinary/institutional collaborations where possible. The guiding questions from before are good prep, here's two more:

[so see prep for interview 1 as well](./interview-prep-1.md)

Research wise, the [Metaresearch group](http://metaresearch.nl) will provide a fruitful group for discussions wrt research projects undertaken in the Mozilla Fellowship and fine-tuning from a meta-point of view the materials produced during the fellowship. All the research that tries to improve science fits right the group's work, albeit the group is less focused on implementing change. However, in preparing for this fellowship application, I talked to some group members and they're enthousiastic about practical implementations and so are happy to join in thinking and potentially doing applied research on this. 

The remaining 1 day p/week that I'll work on my PhD is fully supported by the uni (already checked); as such I don't see any problems with support regarding an office, institutional support etc. Given the reduced labor costs for the university, I will try to negotiate for budget to spend within the mozilla fellowship (if granted). As such, I have full availability of institional resources and supervision to take on research projects. 

My PhD project (which has pretty much become a PhD on improving science as a system) is likely to be have passed the completion stage when I would start the fellowship, making all other projects additions to that PhD project. As such, I will be at liberty to start projects as I see fit and intertwine the Mozilla Fellowship with PhD project, allowing me to use the resources of the institution towards the goals of both the Fellowship and PhD project.

>What are you most looking for in terms of collaborators in the coming year (disciplinary focus, institutions, particular types of people -- scientists, developers, web activists etcet)?

From interview 1 prep:

  1. Explicitly, I will primarily be looking for research users _and_ contributors.
  2. However, I have tons of ideas I want to put into practice that relate to open science

New: I have been in touch with the social science faculty graduate school and have discussed the option to set up onboarding protocols for incoming PhD candidates. This was received positively. The graduate student supervisor received much positive feedback on a 3h workshop I gave last year on "Project Management". Apparently there is a large desire for more of these workshops, as I intend to develop within a potential fellowship. All these materials will be available online, and I look to apply these locally within my university first five months (approximately), fine-tune these, and then spread via both physical meetings (uni's throughout the Netherlands) and online meetings (whoever feels like participating).

I will start out in social sciences, but will try to make the material as neutral as possible or dynamic as possible to be usable across fields. This is why I will also reach out to other faculty's graduate schools, PhD councils to see what their needs are and request input for the materials. So this will primarily focus on PhD candidate's and their desires to learn more about how to do modern research in their field, while at the same time being able to learn from other fields.

I hope to engage PhD supervisors in this onboarding process by also incorporating modular [TOP-initiative] like guidelines for the PhD candidates to commit to after discussing with their supervisors. Based on the idea that it is easier to make a decision based on values than on pragmatism the further away the decision moment is, my hope is to have explicit commitments to data sharing, publishing openly, etc. in order to make it easier 

>What are your travel commitments and requirements for the next few months? Please surface any conflicts we should accommodate for the September-June Fellowship tenure.
