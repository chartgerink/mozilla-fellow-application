# Mozilla fellowship application

This is my Mozilla fellowship (2017) application. If granted, I'll be updating. Please view my interview preparation [here](./interview-prep-1.md).

## Application

## What research fields are you in? (25 words)

Meta-research; Applied Methods and Statistics in the Social Sciences; psychology

## What is your research focus? (50 words) 

My PhD project focuses on detecting data fabrication and bias in empirical science. My personal interest has developed into creating a sustainable and healthy scholarly environment for the people and the outputs, with sound incentive systems and permissive use of content.

## Describe to us your current research team. (50 words) 

Together with nine colleagues we form the Meta-Research Center, which investigates how researchers do research and how that affects the validity of scientific results. Together, we develop methods to detect and correct for bias in science, and contribute to sound science (e.g., Reproducibility Project: Psychology).
 
## Describe to us how open science advances your research. (100 words) *

Open Science helps me manage my projects and helps me collaborate with my peers in a fun but responsible manner. Open Science has also saved my skin several times, when I was unable to recall specifics of the research process, which were documented in my version-controlled project. 

I started supervising students using Github. Students find it a natural way of working and a fun way to collaborate. It increases the amount of interaction (also when co-authoring), allowing for more moments to touch base about topics. As a consequence, the resulting science tends to be of higher quality. 

## Are you leading any projects related to open science? (100 words) *

Yes, I am working on Liberate Science to ensure public access to the public domain (also took part in Mozilla Open Leadership program with this project; non-functional demo: https://libscie.github.io/liberator). I am also trying to imagine a scholarly communications system if it started from scratch today (based on p2p and blockchain, see WIP at https://chartgerink.github.io/2017future/), which I want to revise with the community in the next year and then actually start building it after my PhD is completed. 

## How do you see Mozilla advancing your work? (50 words) *

During the Open Leadership program I learned much about community based collaboration. I hope to extend and implement more collaborative efforts during the fellowship and implement hands-on Open Science modules within my own community.

## What do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project? (50 words) *

Tilburg University named Open Science one of seven pillars for 2018-2021; I want to coordinate the starting phase by building community and support at both the executive level and the grassroots level (primarily PhDs). I aim to collect data on the efficiency of Open Science, as evidence-base for policy elsewhere.

## What do you think needs to change most immediately in scientific research? (100 words) *

Research needs to be communicated more honestly and more often. The article as we now know it is too limited and too polished, making it very difficult to admit mistakes. As such, we are often going down paths because people are reluctant to admit that the results weren't truthfully presented but in a beautified manner. Access to the communications is also crucial, which is easy when platforms such as github are used to make information available in a timely manner.

## What project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web? (50 words) *

`dat` and `Hyperledger`, which provide a powerful combination for a truly decentralized and verified Internet. These tools also allow for a universally accessible scholarly commons that is distributed among all and verified by everyone. It immediately solves the chronology/publication bias and access problems if implemented properly.

## Why is the the open web important to you? (25 words) *	

An open web empowers people; physical freedom was secured after feudal/slavery system (in the north), but control of information is only secured by open web.

## Mozilla recently launched The Internet Health Report, a crowdsourced initiative to catalog the state of the web. Which of the 5 themes relate most to your work? *
 
Open Innovation / Digital Inclusion / _Decentralization_ / Privacy & Security / Web Literacy

## Why did you select that issue? (25 words) *

Decentralization removes control over information flows, which is how the open web can empower people. Moreover, a decentralized scholarly system can solve many science crises.

## Links to 2 of your projects that have high relevance to open science *

## Are you comfortable with semi-regular travel? *

Yes. I live alone and have traveled regularly in recent years for conferences, workshops, meet ups. I have no children or regular physical social obligations that keep me from traveling.

## What are your travel constraints? *

Physical travel constraints are minimal. I cannot guarantee that I am able to enter all countries due to (future) regulations I will not subject myself to (e.g., if U.S.A. implements mandatory password disclosure). I also most likely will be occupied 11-13 November.
